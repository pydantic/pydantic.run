# [pydantic.run](https://pydantic.run)

Python sandbox based on [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org). Write and share Python code, run it in the browser.

Built to demonstrate [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev), [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev), and [Pydantic Logfire](https://docs.pydantic.dev/logfire).

If you choose to save code, it's stored in CloudFlare's R2 object storage, and should be available for one year.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are installed when code is run.

Dependencies can be defined in one of two ways:

### Inferred from imports

If there's no metadata, dependencies are inferred from imports in the code.

```py
import pydantic

class Model(pydantic.BaseModel):
    x: int

print(Model(x='42'))
```

### Inline script metadata

As introduced in PEP 723, explained [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata), and popularised by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies) â€” dependencies can be defined in a comment at the top of the file.

This allows use of dependencies that aren't imported in the code, and is more explicit.

```py
# /// script
# dependencies = ["pydantic", "email-validator"]
# ///
import pydantic

class Model(pydantic.BaseModel):
    email: pydantic.EmailStr

print(Model(email='hello@pydantic.dev'))
```

It also allows version to be pinned for non-binary packages (Pyodide only supports a single version for the binary packages it supports, like `pydantic` and `numpy`).

```py
# /// script
# dependencies = ["rich<13"]
# ///
import rich
from importlib.metadata import version

rich.print(f'[red]Rich version:[/red] [blue]{version('rich')}[/blue]')
```

### Sandbox via link

To programmatically create a sandbox, make a `GET` request to `https://pydantic.run/new`, with the `files` parameter set to a JSON object containing the files you want to show.

The response is a 302 redirect to the newly created sandbox, hence you can direct a user to a sandbox with the code you want them to see. Repeated requests with the same `files` will use the same sandbox.

`files` should be an array of objects with the following keys:

- `name` - (string) the name of the file
- `content` - (string) the content of the file
- **Optionally** `activeIndex` - (integer) indicating which file/tab is open by default, the highest value wins

You can also set the `tab` parameter to select which tab is open by default, that advantage of using this over `activeIndex` is that it will reuse the same sandbox for requests choosing different tabs.

Here's a minimal HTML page that provides a link to create a new sandbox with two files:

```html
<div>loading...</div>
<script>
  const files = [
    {
      name: 'main.py',
      content: 'print("This is an example!")',
      activeIndex: 1,
    },
    {
      name: 'another.py',
      content: 'x = 42\nprint(f"The answer is {x}")',
    },
  ]
  const redirectUrl = new URL('https://pydantic.run/new')
  redirectUrl.searchParams.append('files', JSON.stringify(files))
  document.querySelector('div').innerHTML = `<a href="${redirectUrl}">Click here to create a new sandbox</a>`
</script>
```

## Running code on the server

`pydantic.run` has experimental support for running code server-side using [CloudFlare Python Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/).

**WARNING:**:

1. This feature is experimental in CloudFlare, behaviour might change in the future.
2. The Cloudflare worker running this code is managed by Pydantic, we may change or remove this in the future.
3. While we don't intentionally log the code that is run or it's output, we can't guarantee we won't view or record it at some point.

To run code server-side, using the [pydantic.run](https://pydantic.run) UI, add a `#server` to the end of the URL and reload the page, you'll then see a "run on server" toggle.

To run code server-side programmatically, make a `POST` request to `https://sandbox.pydantic.run/run/` with the Python code you want to run in the request body.

If you want the return value of the code, include a function called `main()` (async or not) in the code you send.

Unlike in the browser based `pydantic.run` environment, async code must be wrapped in an async `main` function to be run.

For information about the data returned, see the API documentation at [sandbox.pydantic.run/redoc/](https://sandbox.pydantic.run/redoc/).

The following packages are available server-side:

- `pydantic`
- `numpy`
- `httpx`
- `fastapi` - used to run the server

## Server side limitations

1. You cannot install new packages, and we cannot change the version of packages available, only [these](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/#supported-packages) packages are available.
2. The CPU limit on the server is very small, if you want to sleep or do any IO, it will need to be async.
